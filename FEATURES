Can detect:
-Possibly unescaped model attributes or parameters in views (Cross-Site Scripting)
-Bad string interpolation in calls to Model.find, Model.last, Model.first, etc., as well as chained calls (SQL Injection)
-String interpolation in find_by_sql (SQL Injection)
-String interpolation or params in calls to system, exec, and syscall and `` (Command Injection)
-Unrestricted mass assignments
-Global restriction of mass assignment
-Missing call to protect_from_forgery in ApplicationController (CSRF protection)
-Default routes, per-controller and globally
-Redirects based on params (probably too broad currently)
-Validation regexes not using \A and \z
-Calls to render with dynamic paths

General capabilities:
-Search for method calls based on target class and/or method name
-Determine 'output' of templates using ERB, Erubis, or HAML. Can handle automatic escaping
